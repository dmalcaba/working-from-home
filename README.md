# Working From Home

In the next few days, I'll be adding work from home tips. Although some of the tips are focused on a software developer routine, most of the tips here should be applicable to other telecommuting jobs.

## Maintain the same routine as if you are going to the office

- Take a shower.
- Wear appropriate clothes.
- Eat your breakfast.
- Drink coffee, or tea, whichever you prefer

## Choose a dedicated work space

- If possible, avoid using your bedroom as work space.
